	<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
	<p>This is house isn’t just a normal housing but had an interesting story behind. And it wasn’t like this years ago, but a very small cabin owned by a man. He was the first owner of this house, and after years, another person had thought about this house so he starts to reconstructive the housing and makes this original cabin into a normal house in this 5,625 sqft area. But the story hasn’t really ended because he renovated it, he hasn’t really lived in very normal life so that the housing became a mortgage soon.  Now, the building we see today has totally changed from both inside and outside by the current owner, he bought this house and designed all parts to became what we can see now.</p>
	<p>There are so many elements and features that you probably won’t see in other local houses, for example, various elements form a diversified space, which is the blending of western and eastern culture, of the ancient and the modern. Such a space is grand in itself! The owner graduated in the architecture design field; he understands the character of the different houses around the US. So, here is something that is interesting. This house isn’t built for local New Yorkers, but people all around the country. Let’s see how the house looked like!</p>
