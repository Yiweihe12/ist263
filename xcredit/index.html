			<h1>Yiwei's Biography</h1>
		</header>
			<p>
				Hi, This is me, Yiwei. I am about to show you who I am.
			</p>

			<p>
				I love to create, think and read. Creating amusing and funny images, posters, and layouts that I would laugh so hard when I saw them. Thinking about thousands of ideas before I start to plan my work, reading countless books in one year but never finish one book in a week.
				This is who I am when you know me so much, but who I really am if you don’t know me?
				I was born and raised up in China, a country which has great history and culture.  I always love to know more about it and its mysterious background. But last year when I was 18, I chose to come to the U.S for my undergraduate study.
			</p>
			<p>
				I love going to museums, galleries to gain more inspirations and ideas while my brain went blank. I love traveling so that I could see the world in a different view, not just what I learned from textbook. Being as a designer is supercool and fun, getting to know many different people from various background, and get feedback not only from designers, colleagues, friend, but also strangers. UI/UX side of design also gives me the option of knowing human side of integration with technology, and give me more space to explore interesting design ideas.
				I have been worked a lot of different range of project from 3D to motion graphics, from digital album cover to fine art exhibition, from UI/UX design to video edditing. I have made so many works that include what I love and hate. 
				Instead of words I prefer <strong>graphics</strong>, <strong>colors</strong> and ink on paper.
